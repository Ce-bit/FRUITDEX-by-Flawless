# Android Local Fruit Detection App using TensorFlow Lite image classification

## Overview

FRUITDEX by FLawless uses 
[TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite)
[Image classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/image_classification/overview)
to continuously classify whatever it sees from the device's back camera.
Inference is performed using the TensorFlow Lite Java API. The demo app
classifies frames in real-time, displaying the top most probable
classifications. It allows the user to choose between a floating point or
[quantized](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization)
model, select the thread count, and decide whether to run on CPU, GPU, or via
[NNAPI](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks).
